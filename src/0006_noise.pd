#X text 124 4 "Noise is variously described as unpitched \, indeterminate
\, uncontrolled \, loud \, unmusical \, or unwanted sound. Noise is
an important component of the sound of the human voice and all musical
instruments \, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and
electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create
various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted
\, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre \, such
as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum \, or the
transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes."
